## Buchla

### 1. History of each synth and who built it.

Buchla Electronic Musical Instruments was founded by Don Buchla in 1963 in Berkeley, California. The first modular electronic music system, the Buchla 100 series, was developed in 1963–1965, commissioned by composers Ramon Sender and Morton Subotnick with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation. It was installed at the San Francisco Tape Music Center in 1965. The company evolved through various ownership changes, including acquisition by Audio Supermarket Pty. Ltd. in 2012 (renamed BEMI) and Buchla U.S.A. in 2018. Key developments include the Buchla 200 series in 1970, computer-controlled instruments in the mid-1970s, and the 200e series in 2004. Don Buchla, the creator, pioneered voltage-controlled modular designs with unique interfaces like touch-sensitive surfaces.
