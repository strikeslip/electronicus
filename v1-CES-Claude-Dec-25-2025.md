### Design Philosophy
From JD-800 manual: *"The original purpose of the synthesizer was to 'create sound'... We asked, 'Why don't we return to the roots of synthesis; the enjoyment of creating original sounds?'"*

### Development Context (Late 1980s)
- Kazuhisa Takahashi: "Around 1990, digital workstation synths and multitimbral sound sources were at their peak. Analog knobs and synths were old-fashioned."
- Takahashi's frustration: "I became frustrated by the technique of creating sounds numerically on small LCD screens"
- Support from Ikutaro Kakehashi + booming Japanese economy = no-compromise instrument

### Sound Design
- **Updated LA Synthesis:** Short PCM samples (attack) + digital subtractive synthesis (sustain)
- Added loopable samples, multi-samples for better tracking
- 44.1kHz sample rate on all waveforms
- **Digital filter (TVF):** Switchable lowpass, bandpass, highpass with nasty resonance
- **3 envelopes** (filter, amplitude, oscillator pitch)
- **2 LFOs**
- **High-quality effects:** Distortion, phasing, chorus, delay, reverb

### Sound Programmers
- **Eric Persing:** Created core waveforms and factory presets
- **First Roland instrument with core presets developed entirely in USA** (Culver City, California)

### Commercial Reception
- **Not highly successful at launch** (musicians wanted workstations, not "just a synthesizer")
- No disk drive (unusual for 1991)
- Small screens vs. competitors
- **Today:** Cult following, appreciated for unique sound and hands-on control

### Notable Artists
- **William Orbit, Emerson Lake & Palmer** (Keith Emerson)
